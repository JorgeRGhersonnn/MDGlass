The motion of particles in a molecular system is governed by Newtonâ€™s second law, which states that the force acting on a particle is 
equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In mathematical terms, for a system of $N$ particles, each having mass $m_i$, 
and position $\mathbf{r}_i\$, the equation takes the form:
$$\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}.$$

The force $\mathbf{F}_i$ is derived from the interatomic potential $U(\mathbf{r})$ by taking its negative gradient:
$$\mathbf{F}_i = -\mathbf{\nabla}_i \, U(\mathbf{r}_i.)$$
